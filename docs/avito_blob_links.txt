# Note:
# These are `blob:` URLs (browser-only object URLs). They cannot be fetched directly via HTTP from a script.
# If you need the content, open each link in the browser (in developer tools) and save the resource to disk, or
# ask me to guide you through exchanging authorization and saving the underlying resource from the web UI.
